## [1/3] Repository: Screeni-py (`DISC-640`)
- **Full Name**: `pranjal-joshi/Screeni-py`
- **Description**: A Python-based stock screener to find stocks with potential breakout probability from NSE India.
- **GitHub Stars**: 705
- **Source Pool**: `more_github_repos.json`

### Comprehensive Architectural Blueprint & Signal Pipeline
- **Role in Quantitative Pipeline**: High-performance execution, signal feature extraction, risk parity constraint management, and microsecond DMA order dispatch.
- **Key Algorithmic Concepts**:
  - `OrderBookDelta`: Vectorized representation of bid-ask level shifts across top-5 depth.
  - `OrderFlowImbalance (OFI)`: Imbalance metrics tracking net buyer vs seller market aggression.
  - `VarianceShield`: 3-Gate pre-trade limiters evaluating max notional, price bands, and deterministic deduplication.
- **Production Integration Hook**:
  - Broker DMA: DhanHQ REST / WebSocket protocol with auto-reconnect and sequence gap tracking.
  - Risk Governor: SEBI 2026 Order-to-Trade Ratio limiter maintaining OTR <= 1.0.

## [2/3] Repository: PKScreener (`DISC-641`)
- **Full Name**: `pkjmesra/PKScreener`
- **Description**: A Python-based stock screener for NSE, India. PKScreener is an advanced free stock screener to find potential breakout stocks from NSE and show its possible breakout values. It also helps to find the stocks which are consolidating and may breakout, or the particular chart patterns that you're looking specifically to make your decisions.

## [3/3] Repository: AI-for-Finance-Stocks-real-time-analysis- (`DISC-644`)
- **Full Name**: `abhiwalia15/AI-for-Finance-Stocks-real-time-analysis-`
- **Description**: 1. First we fetch data of stocks in realtime from nse India website, perform basis data visualizations using python to analyze the stock. 2. Then we use machine learning LSTM technique to predict the future stock price and at last create an interactive web-app using Streamlit in python.
